# How UBECO PROFIL Can Help You Design Better Roll Formed Profiles
 
Roll forming is a process of shaping sheet metal into custom profiles or seamed tubes by passing it through a series of rollers. It is a cost-effective and efficient way of producing parts with long lengths or large quantities.

However, roll forming also involves many challenges, such as choosing the right material, calculating the optimal flower pattern, designing the roll tooling, and avoiding defects like springback, buckling, or twisting.
 
That's where UBECO PROFIL comes in. UBECO PROFIL is a roll form design software that helps you plan, design, calculate, and draw your roll formed profiles or seamed tubes with ease and accuracy. It is a CAD-like software that works with Windows and has a direct interface with SOLIDWORKS.
 
With UBECO PROFIL, you can:
 
- Create and edit your profile geometry with simple commands and tools.
- Generate the flower pattern automatically or manually, with options to refine the bend zones and adjust the correction elements.
- Design the roll tooling based on your profile geometry and material properties, with options to modify the roll diameter, width, pitch, gap, etc.
- Perform finite element analysis (FEA) to simulate the roll forming process and evaluate the stress, strain, deformation, and forces on your profile and rolls.
- Export your profile, flower pattern, and roll tooling drawings to DXF or STEP formats, or transfer them directly to SOLIDWORKS or ZWCAD via ActiveX interface.

UBECO PROFIL is a powerful and user-friendly software that can help you design better roll formed profiles or seamed tubes in less time and with less cost. It is trusted by many manufacturers of cold roll-formed profiles or seamed tubes from sheet metal and designers of roll formers and tube mills around the world.
