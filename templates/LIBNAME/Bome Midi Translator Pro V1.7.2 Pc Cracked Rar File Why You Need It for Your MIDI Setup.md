Ableton Live is a popular software for music production and live performance. It allows you to create, record, edit, and mix audio and MIDI tracks, as well as to use effects, instruments, and samples. You can also use Ableton Live to control external MIDI devices and applications.
 
One of the ways to control Ableton Live with a MIDI controller is to use Bome Midi Translator Pro.

You can also use the knobs and sliders of your MIDI keyboard to control the volume, pan, send, and device parameters of the tracks in Ableton Live's Mixer View. You can also use the buttons of your MIDI keyboard to switch between different views and modes in Ableton Live.
