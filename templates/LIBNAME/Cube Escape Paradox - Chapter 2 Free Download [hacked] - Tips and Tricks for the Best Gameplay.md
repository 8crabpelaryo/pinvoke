Cube Escape: Paradox is a unique game that combines a point-and-click adventure with a short film. You play as Dale Vandermeer, a detective who wakes up in a strange room with no memory of who he is or how he got there. You have to solve puzzles and find clues to escape the room and recover your memories. Along the way, you will encounter familiar characters and locations from the previous Cube Escape games and the Rusty Lake universe.
 
The game has two chapters, each with different puzzles and endings. The first chapter is free to play on Steam, but the second chapter costs $2.99 (or $1.79 if you buy it during the current promotion). The second chapter is more challenging and reveals more about the story and the meaning of "Paradox".
 
However, some people might not want to pay for the second chapter or wait for it to be available on Steam. They might search for a hacked version online that allows them to play it for free. But this is not a good idea for several reasons.
 
- First of all, downloading a hacked version of Cube Escape: Paradox - Chapter 2 might expose your device to viruses, malware, or other harmful software. You never know what kind of files you are getting from an untrusted source. You might end up damaging your device or compromising your personal information.
- Secondly, downloading a hacked version of Cube Escape: Paradox - Chapter 2 might ruin your gaming experience. You might miss out on important features, updates, or bug fixes that the developers have implemented in the official version. You might also encounter glitches, errors, or crashes that prevent you from enjoying the game properly.
- Thirdly, downloading a hacked version of Cube Escape: Paradox - Chapter 2 might disrespect the developers and their hard work. Rusty Lake is an independent studio that has been creating amazing games for years. They deserve to be supported and appreciated for their creativity and quality. By paying for the second chapter, you are showing them that you value their work and want them to continue making more games in the future.

Therefore, we recommend that you avoid downloading a hacked version of Cube Escape: Paradox - Chapter 2 and instead buy it from Steam or other official platforms. You will not only get a better and safer gaming experience, but also support a talented and passionate team of developers.
